# Matplotlib to Go Migration Notes

This project keeps Matplotlib's plotting model and visual behavior where it can,
but the Go API uses typed option structs instead of Python's dynamic keyword
and property-dict conventions.

## Phase 17.75.2 Axes Helpers

The 17.75.2 helpers cover common Matplotlib migration calls with intentionally
typed signatures:

- `Axes.Bxp` and `pyplot.Bxp` accept `[]core.BxpStat` plus
  `core.BxpOptions`, instead of Python's list of dictionaries and separate
  `boxprops`, `whiskerprops`, `capprops`, and related property dictionaries.
- `Axes.Violin` and `pyplot.Violin` accept `[]core.ViolinStat` plus
  `core.ViolinStatsOptions`, mirroring Matplotlib's precomputed-stat contract
  while keeping styling and visibility flags in a typed options value.
- `Axes.HLines`, `Axes.VLines`, `pyplot.HLines`, and `pyplot.VLines` accept
  slice inputs and a `core.LineCollection` style value. Single-value endpoints
  or extents broadcast across multiple positions like Matplotlib; masked-array
  handling and Python's full color/linestyle alias grammar remain out of scope.
- `Axes.Clabel`, `ContourSet.Clabel`, and `pyplot.Clabel` accept a
  `core.ClabelOptions` value for level filtering, formatter, font size, color,
  inline spacing, and manual label positions. GUI-driven manual placement and
  exact Python `Text` artist compatibility remain partial.

The parity fixture `axes_convenience_helpers` exercises these helpers against
Matplotlib 3.10.9 reference output.

### Source Alignment

The covered helpers were checked against the vendored Matplotlib 3.10.9 source
in `third_party/matplotlib`:

- `Axes.HLines` and `Axes.VLines` track
  `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` `Axes.hlines` and `Axes.vlines` by
  normalizing scalar-like endpoints/extents, creating data-space two-point
  segments, registering a `LineCollection`, and updating data limits through
  the collection path. The Go API accepts slices and one optional typed
  `LineCollection`; Python `data=`, masked arrays, arbitrary `**kwargs`, and
  color/linestyle alias normalization are intentionally not mirrored.
- `Axes.Bxp` tracks `Axes.bxp` by consuming precomputed median/quartile/whisker
  stats, deriving default positions, widths, and cap widths, drawing boxes,
  whiskers, caps, medians, optional means/fliers, and optionally managing tick
  labels. Go returns a `core.BxpContainer` of typed `Line2D` groups and does
  not implement Python's `patch_artist`, rcParam/property-dict merging, pending
  `vert` deprecation path, or dynamic legend/property alias behavior.
- `Axes.Violin` tracks `Axes.violin` by consuming precomputed `coords`/`vals`
  density stats, normalizing density to half-width, honoring
  vertical/horizontal orientation and `both`/`low`/`high` sides, and drawing
  body, mean, median, extrema, and quantile collections. Go keeps collection
  return values in `core.ViolinContainer` and leaves Python's exact return-dict
  key shape and rcParam color-cycle details partial.
- `Axes.Clabel`, `ContourSet.Clabel`, and `pyplot.Clabel` track
  `Axes.clabel` and `ContourLabeler.clabel`: the axes method delegates to the
  contour set, level filtering must match existing contour levels, formatters
  and colors are applied to generated labels, and manual iterable positions are
  supported. GUI/manual event-loop placement, `rightside_up`,
  `use_clabeltext`, and exact `Text` artist return semantics remain out of
  scope for the typed Go surface.

## Phase 17.75.3 Axes Option Breadth

The 17.75.3 option-breadth work covers visible high-use options through typed
Go option structs:

- `Axes.Hist` and `pyplot.Hist` support weighted samples, explicit histogram
  ranges, density normalization based on the in-range weighted total, and
  right-to-left cumulative density through `ReverseCumulative`.
- `Axes.Scatter` supports per-point sizes, per-point face/edge colors, scalar
  values mapped through a colormap/norm, and Matplotlib's default
  edgecolor-face behavior for scalar-mapped markers.
- `Axes.Bar`, `Axes.BarH`, and `Axes.BarLabel` support per-bar widths/colors,
  edge alignment, explicit baselines, and edge labels that use the stacked bar
  endpoint rather than only the segment height.
- `Axes.FillBetween` and `Axes.FillBetweenX` support `where` masks,
  interpolation at crossing boundaries, and `pre`/`post`/`mid` step expansion.
- `Axes.ErrorBar` supports `errorevery` stride/start selection while keeping
  the data line complete.
- Path collections and quad meshes expose typed mutable setters for visible
  scalar-map, offset, style, and rectilinear-edge changes.

These were checked against vendored Matplotlib 3.10.9 in
`third_party/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` and
`third_party/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/collections.py`. The Go API keeps
explicit fields such as `core.HistOptions.Weights`,
`core.ScatterOptions.ScalarValues`, `core.BarOptions.Align`,
`core.FillOptions.Where`, and `core.ErrorBarOptions.ErrorEvery` instead of
Python's dynamic `**kwargs`, `data=`, property dictionaries, and overload
grammar. Multi-dataset histogram inputs, broad alias normalization, masked
array input objects, and exact Python container/property mutation semantics
remain partial.

The parity fixture `axes_option_breadth_17_75_3` exercises visible scatter,
bar-label, fill-between, and errorbar option behavior against Matplotlib 3.10.9
reference output. Collection and mesh mutable-setter behavior is covered by
focused unit tests and existing mesh/colorbar fixtures where it produces
visible output.

## Phase 17.75.4 mplot3d Depth and Clipping

The 17.75.4 depth/clipping audit aligns common static mplot3d helpers with
Matplotlib 3.10.9 while keeping the Go API typed:

- `Axes3D.Plot3D`, `Scatter3D`, `Wireframe`, `Quiver3D`, `Stem3D`, and
  `ErrorBar3D` support explicit-limit clipping through typed `AxLimClip`
  fields and reproject their geometry when view limits or camera state change.
- `Axes3D.Surface`, `Contour`, `Contourf`, `TriContour`, `TriContourf`,
  `Trisurf`, `Bar3D`, and `FillBetween3D` use projected collection z-ordering
  and face/polygon ordering where the renderer needs stable static output.
  Offset-plane contour clipping and typed `AxLimClip` options follow
  Matplotlib's `axlim_clip` intent.
- `Axes3D.Voxels` culls adjacent internal faces, sorts visible faces by
  projected depth, supports typed `AxLimClip`, and clears stale projected
  geometry when a view-limit reprojection removes a voxel.

Intentional differences remain: Go does not mirror Python's full positional
overload grammar, `data=` dispatch, masked-array machinery, GUI event methods,
or mutable `Poly3DCollection`/`Line3DCollection` internals. Projection and depth
ordering are implemented as deterministic pre-projected 2D artists, so rare
interpenetrating 3D geometry can still differ from Matplotlib's painter-order
heuristics.
